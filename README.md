# Essence Coding Challenge

## Goal:
 
To produce a demo build of a business related application and showcase how this would be logically structured.
 
We are looking for examples of smart testable component design/architecture, how presentation and service logic is handled, the management of http calls, application flow and management of shared data within the application.
 
## Functional/Technical requirements:
 
- SSO integration (preferably Google but others are fine)
- Providing the Authentication State Persistence
- Page level authorisation
- Form handling with validation
- Graph and tabular data viz with sorting, filtering, pagination
- API integration (completely free to choose this to be any public API)
- Unit and integration tests a minimum, with BDD tests using tools like Cypress would be good to see but not essential
